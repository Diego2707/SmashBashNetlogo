## WHAT IS IT?
A imitation of the popular game Super Mario Bros.
Bowser has taken over Mushroom kingdom and has captured Princess Peach. It is up to you (Mario), to save Princess Peach, defeat Bowser and save all of Mushroom Kingdom.
## HOW IT WORKS
If goomba catches you/in the same patch as you, you will lose a life or if you are powered up, you will lose that power up.
If a koopa cataches you/in the same patch as you, you will lose a life or if you are powered up, you will lose that power up.
If there is a block with a question mark on it, there is something inside it that you should bump from underneath the block.
If you get collect a mushroom, you will power up, grow bigger and be able to break blocks.
If you collect a fire flower, you will be able to throw fireballs.
If you collect a starman, you will be invincible against enemies, so that they can't harm you for a short period of time.
## HOW TO USE IT
To move forward, press key D.
To move backward, press key A.
To jump, press key W.
To go down, press key S.
To jump and move forward or backward at the same time, press key W and left-click your mouse to the right or left, depending on your direction.
(ANYTHING ELSE?)
## THINGS TO NOTICE
Do not go too fast or you will get warped back to where you are.

## THINGS TO TRY
Try to break all of the blocks.
Try to empty all the question blocks.
Try going down the pipes.
## EXTENDING THE MODEL
There are many things that can be added to this model like adding more levels and allowing Mario to move backwards past the interactions tab. Another thing that can be added are the moving mushrooms and fire flowers. The reason that it was not included was that it would lag the game.
## NETLOGO FEATURES
Something that was hardcoded was the world after setup and it was repetitive. In the code, many functions had inputs in it to allow repetition and to make columns for the ground blocks, pipes and many other things in Mushroom Kingdom.
## RELATED MODELS
A model that is relatively related to Super Mario Bros is Pacman. This is beacuse in Pacman, if the ghost and Pacman are on the same patch, Pacman will lose a life. Also in Pacman, when Pacman gets a power-up, there is one power-up that is the same as a power-up in Super Mario Bros, invincibility.
